            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>I had to analyze an existing and highly adopted application and incorporate a new feature into the existing product. The feature I developed was to be based on an area of ​​functionality that should be explored and compared with user input. Out of many app options, WhatsApp was randomly assigned to me.</p>
            
            </div>

            <p class="title">Empathize stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>As we all know, WhatsApp is an instant messaging application for smartphones to send and receive messages. It is automatically integrated into the contact book, which differentiates it from other applications since it is not necessary to enter a password or PIN to access the service.</p>

                <p>WhatsApp has become in the instant messaging applications globally leader, with over 2000 million of users. In Mexico, more than 90% of the population use this application to messaging.
                </p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>All the benefits on WhatsApp have made it the best application to messaging, however it can improve some of their functions, one of them related to the group chats</p>

                <p>Most of the time chat groups on WhatsApp are created for a certain purpose, such as a birthday party, weekend events, or events for work projects. After the event, chat groups are never used again and people end whit lots of useless chat groups</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">

                </div>

                <p>What if WhatsApp would have a feature to create temporary groups? It would be very useful for organizing events whit specific beginning time and ending time</p>

            </div>

            <p class="title">User</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>With a huge range of users, this feature would be beneficial for most of us, particularly for those lovers of clean applications and the organization. </p>

                <p>My user is a woman who cares about organizing all of the content of her applications. Due to her work and life conditions, she needs to stay connected with family, friends, and especially with coworkers and that her main reason for use chat groups in WhatsApp. She is a really organized person that hates has to archive the unused chat groups on WhatsApp.</p>

            <p class="title">Define stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>The real challenge in this project was discovering how your system works and what are the main characteristics of one of the most important messaging applications.</p>

                <p>In the development of this project, it was important to know how to create chat groups, how many participants are allowed in a group or how the user interacts with the function to archive a chat</p>

                <p>This new feature would avoid, unused groups, awkward feelings when you leave a chat group, and the spam that causes a useless chat group </p>

            </div>

            <p class="title">Information Architecture</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">

                <p>After understanding the user flow in the existing application and what would be the entry point for the new feature, I started to think about how the user could interact with the new functionality</p>

                <p>In order to avoid dead groups with no new messages or interaction between participants, now you could create a temporary new chat group that will disappear automatically after the expiration date. This way, you will no longer have to worry about leaving group chats that you do not use.</p>

                <p>After make a new temporary group, you need to select the expiration date</p>

                <p>One day before the expiration date, you will receive a notification in case you need to backup files</p>

                <p>In the design phase, I needed to be careful about the look and feel of the new feature. In order to keep the same style, I developed the style guide for WhatsApp</p>
