                <p>Along with the coming of fast-fashion, the buy and discard became a tendency, bringing devastating consequences for the planet and people who work for this industry</p>

                <p>The user research process gave us some insights into the actual status of second-hand clothes selling and our users' needs that we  compare along with general fashion market.</p>
                <p>For many people buying second-hand clothes is very risky, considered vulgar and many thought is only for low-class people. User concerns were mainly centered on myths about where clothing is from, fabric quality, and secure online payment methods.</p>

                </div>
                <p>But on the other hand, typical customers of second-hand clothing recommend this kind of clothes because they got some unique garments on this market.Besides, there is second-hand clothing of excellent quality and in perfect condition with a longer life than a new garment from fast-fashion.Finally, nowadays exists good options for secure payment methods even if its a new online shop and is still growing. The real challenge gain the confidence of our customers to purchase on a new app</p>
