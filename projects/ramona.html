            <p class="title">The challenge</p>
            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>This was a team project created during the UX/UI Ironhack Bootcamp in a real-life scenario.</p>
                <p>It started as a challenge to help a local shop to improve their online presence to be more competitive in the market. Our main goal was to deliver a great shopping experience to end-users.</p>
                <p>The local shop is Ramona Bazares, an entrepreneur project focused on second-hand clothes selling. After discussing the business needs with the client, it was decided to help Ramona to create an e-commerce from scratch. This e-commerce would highlight their value proposition and fit in with the user needs.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Empathize stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>Along with the coming of fast-fashion, the buy and discard became a tendency. This has brought devastating consequences to the planet and to people who work in this industry.</p>

                <p>Under these circumstances, new eco-friendly and accountable alternatives have been born so buying second hand has became a truly revolutionary act.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/factoverview.png" alt="Ninety-five percent of discarded clothing could be recycled or reused">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Overview market</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Research</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>The user research process gave us some insights into the actual status of second-hand clothes selling and users' needs. We compared both against the general fashion market.</p>
                <p>Many people considers buying second-hand clothes as a risky practice. It is considered vulgar and many people think it is only for low-class people. Users concerns were mainly centered on myths about were clothing is from, fabric quality, and secure online payment methods.</p>
                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/myths.png" alt="Myths around second-hand clothing">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Insights</span>
                </div>
                <p>Although, typical customers of second-hand clothing recommend this kind of clothes because they had got some unique garments on this market. Besides, costumers and sellers said that there is second-hand clothing of excellent quality and in perfect condition with a longer life than a new garment from fast-fashion. Finally, we know nowadays exists good options for secure payment methods even if its a new online shop and in developing. The real challenge is to gain the confidence of our customers to purchase on a new app.</p>

            <p class="title">User</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>After collect data about our potential users their needs, desires, and pain points related to e-commerce, especially in second-hand clothing, we had an archetype hypothetical, our user persona.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/userramona.png" alt="User Persona">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">User Persona</span>
                </div>

                <p>At the same time, we mapped the user journey to help us to communicate our design decisions to stakeholders, we could explain the strengths and weaknesses of the product based on these tools.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/userjourneyramona.png" alt="User Journey">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">User Journey</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Define stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>With all the data about our users and knowing what was our position in the market in relation to competitors, the next step was decided how our product would be.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of the project, we worked on a web page but as we research as we realized our first point of contact should be a mobile app.</p>

                <p>Our user usually buy second-hand clothing via Instagram, is a common user of smartphones, and the pain point in the payment process reduces in mobile devices due to previous positive experiences.</p>

                <p>Trough our searching and learning process the most important insight that we find was that costumers feel insecure about the origin of second-hand garments. Our principal task was focused to solve that huge pain point.</p>

                <p>How to gain customer confidence about garment origins? Well, we discovered second-hand sellers want to tell stories about what they consider art pieces so if they could tell that stories about the clothes that they sell, the myths would be solved and costumers would felt more confident when they buy second-hand clothing.</p>

                <p>We decided that garments needed to tell their stories in order to empathize better with our users, that was our value proposal. A garment that tells you about its background and how came to your hands.</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p> Through a card sorting method, we obtained feedback and created the site map and defined the user flow to tested with our potential customers.</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">

                <p>We tested the Low-fi prototype to validate our ideas, the result was what expecting however we had to change some details in order to improve the user experience.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The Mid-fi prototype was tested again some task still was difficult to do for some users so in the final stage we polished a few details</p>
                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/mid-fi.png" alt="Mid-Fi Prototypes">

                </div>
                <p>Finally, the Hi-fi prototype was make based on the style guide.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/hi-fi.png" alt="Hi-Fi Prototypes">

                </div>

                <p>In order to iterate, the Hi-fi prototype will be tested, if it's necessary will add some features to improve the experience.</p>

                <p>Ramona was happy with the final product, we accomplished good feedback from our client. At this stage, the project is waiting for funding to put it on mobile platforms and reach more customers.</p>
