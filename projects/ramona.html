            <p class="title">The challenge</p>
            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>We were challenged to help local shops to improve their online presence to be more competitive in the market. In this project, we focussed our efforts on delivering great shopping experiences for end-users.</p>
                <p>We met Ramona Bazares, an entrepreneur project focused on second-hand clothes selling. We helped Ramona to create her e-commerce from scratch, highlighting their value proposal and matching whit our user needs</p>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Empathize stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>Along with the coming of fast-fashion, the buy and discard became a tendency, bringing devastating consequences for the planet and people who work for this industry</p>

                <p>Under these circumstances, new eco-friendly and accountable alternatives have born so buying second hand has become a truly revolutionary act.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/factoverview.png" alt="Ninety-five percent of discarded clothing could be recycled or reused">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Overview market</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Research</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>The user research process gave us some insights into the actual status of second-hand clothes selling and our users' needs that we  compare along with general fashion market.</p>
                <p>For many people buying second-hand clothes is very risky, considered vulgar and many thought is only for low-class people. User concerns were mainly centered on myths about where clothing is from, fabric quality, and secure online payment methods.</p>
                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/myths.png" alt="Myths around second-hand clothing">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Insights</span>
                </div>
                <p>On the other hand, typical customers of second-hand clothing recommend this kind of clothes because they got some unique garments on this market. Besides, there is second-hand clothing of excellent quality and in perfect condition with a longer life than a new garment from fast-fashion.Finally, nowadays exists good options for secure payment methods even if its a new online shop and in developing. The real challenge gain the confidence of our customers to purchase on a new app</p>
            </div>

            <p class="title">User</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>After collect data about our potential users their needs, desires, and pain points in e-commerce, specially  a second-hand clothing store, we realized that we had an archetype hypothetical, our user persona.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/userramona.png" alt="User Persona">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">User Persona</span>
                </div>

                <p>At the same time that we drew the user journey to help us to communicate our design decisions to stakeholders we could explain the strengths and weaknesses of the product.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/userjourneyramona.png" alt="User Journey">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">User Journey</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Define stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>With all the data about our users and a clear point of what was our position in the market in relation to competitors, the next step was decided how our product would be  </p>

                <p>At the beginning of the project, we worked on a web page but as we research as we realized our first point of contact should be a mobile app. So that was our final product.</p>

                <p>Our user get used to buying second-hand clothing via Instagram, is a common user of smartphones, and the pain point in the payment process reduces in mobile devices </p>

                <p>Trough our searching and learning process the most important insight that we find was that costumers feel insecure about the origin of second-hand garments. Our principal task was focused to solve that huge pain point. </p>

                <p>How gain customer confidence about garment origins? Well, we discovered second-hand sellers want to tell stories about what they consider art pieces if they could tell that stories about the clothes that they sell, the myths would be solved and costumers would felt more confidants when they buy second-hand clothing</p>

                <p>We decided that garments needed to tell stories in order to empathize better with our users, that was our value proposal. A garment that tells you about its background and how to get to you</p>

            <p class="title">Information Architecture</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p> Through a card sorting method, we obtained feedback and created the site map. At the same time, we defined the user flow and test with our potential costumers</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">

                <p>We tested the Low-fi prototype to validate our ideas, the result was what expecting however we had to change some details in order to improve the user experience.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">

                </div>

                <p>The Mid-fi prototype was tested again some task still was difficult to do for some users so in the final stage we polished a few details</p>
                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/mid-fi.png" alt="Mid-Fi Prototypes">

                </div>
                <p>
                    Finally, the Hi-fi prototype was make based on the style guide
                    <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                        <img src="../img/hi-fi.png" alt="Hi-Fi Prototypes">
                        <span class="case-study__foot-image">Hi-Fi Prototypes</span>

                </p>

                <p>In order to iterate, the Hi-fi prototype will be tested, if it's necessary will add some features to improve the experience.</p>

                <p>Ramona was happy with the final product, we accomplished good feedback from our client. On this stage, the project is waiting for funding to put it on mobile platforms and reach more customers.</p>
