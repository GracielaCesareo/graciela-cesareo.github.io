            <p class="title">The challenge</p>
            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>This was a team project created during the UX/UI Ironhack Bootcamp in a real-life scenario.</p>
                <p>It started as a challenge to help a local shop to improve their online presence to be more competitive in the market. Our main goal was to deliver a great shopping experience to end-users.</p>
                <p>The local shop is Ramona Bazares, an entrepreneur project focused on second-hand clothes selling. After discussing the business needs with the client, it was decided to help Ramona to create an e-commerce from scratch. This e-commerce would highlight their value proposition and fit in with the user needs.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Empathize stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>Along with the coming of fast-fashion, the buy and discard became a tendency. This has brought devastating consequences to the planet and to people who work in this industry.</p>

                <p>Under these circumstances, new eco-friendly and accountable alternatives have been born so buying second hand has became a truly revolutionary act.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/factoverview.png" alt="Ninety-five percent of discarded clothing could be recycled or reused">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Overview market</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Research</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>The user research process gave us some insights into the actual status of second-hand clothes selling and users' needs. We compared both against the general fashion market.</p>
                <p>Many people considers buying second-hand clothes as a risky practice. It is considered vulgar and many people think it is only for low-class people. Users concerns were mainly centered on myths about were clothing is from, fabric quality, and secure online payment methods.</p>
                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/myths.png" alt="Myths around second-hand clothing">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Insights</span>
                </div>
                <p>Despite of the above myths, typical customers of second-hand clothing recommend this type of clothes because they usually can find unique garments on this market. In addition, customers and sellers said that there is second-hand clothing of excellent quality and in perfect conditions with a longer life-span than a new garment from fast-fashion.</p>
                <p>Lastly, we know that nowaday exist very good options for secure payment methods even if its a new online shop. The real challenge is to gain the confidence from customers to purchase on a new app.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="title">User</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>We created an archetype hypothetical, our user persona after collecting data about our potential users and their needs, desires, and pain points related to e-commerce, especially in second-hand clothing.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/userramona.png" alt="User Persona">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">User Persona</span>
                </div>

                <p>At the same time, we mapped the user journey to help us communicate our design decisions to stakeholders so we could explain the strengths and weaknesses of the product based on these tools.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/userjourneyramona.png" alt="User Journey">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">User Journey</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="title">Define stage</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p>With all the data about our users and knowing which was our position in the market in relation to competitors, the next step decided was how our product would be.</p>

                <p>At the beginning of the project, we worked on a web page but as we researched we realized our first point of contact should be a mobile app.</p>

                <p>Our user usually buys second-hand clothing via Instagram. Is a common user of smartphones, and the pain point in the payment process is reduced in mobile devices due to previous positive experiences.</p>

                <p>During our research process the most important insight that we found was that costumers feel insecure about the origin of second-hand garments. Our principal task focused on solving that huge pain point.</p>

                <p>How to gain customer confidence about garment origins? Well, we discovered second-hand sellers want to tell stories about what they consider art pieces so if they could tell that story about the clothes that they sell, the myths would be solved and costumers would feel more confident when they buy second-hand clothing.</p>

                <p>We decided that garments needed to tell their stories in order to empathize better with our users, that was our value proposal. A garment that tells you about its background and how it ended up in your hands.</p>

            <p class="title">Information Architecture</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">
                <p> A card sorting method was used to obtain feedback and create the site map. We defined a user flow and tested it with our potential customers.</p>

            <div class="case-study__text-block">

                <p>We tested the Low-fi prototype to verify our ideas. The result obtained was as expected, however we had to change some details in order to improve the user experience.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">

                </div>

                <p>The Mid-fi prototype was tested again. Some task still were difficult to do for some users so in the final stage we improved a few details.</p>
                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/mid-fi.png" alt="Mid-Fi Prototypes">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Mid-Fi Prototypes</span>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, the Hi-fi prototype was made based on the style guide.</p>

                <div class="case-study__img-container img-container">
                    <img src="../img/hi-fi.png" alt="Hi-Fi Prototypes">
                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Hi-Fi Prototypes</span>

                    <span class="case-study__foot-image">Style Guide</span>
                </div>

                <p>In order to do the design iteration, the Hi-fi prototype will be tested. If it's necessary will have some features added to improve the experience.</p>

                <p>Ramona Bazares was happy with the final product. We obtained good feedback from our client. At this stage, the project is waiting for funding to develop it on mobile platforms and to reach more customers.</p>
